# Challenge2

## Description
I took that first shot at my portfolio. This was a great exercise to help me find out more about HTML and CSS. I have learned about grids and layout and I am applying what I have learned so far in the Bootcamp. I failed with media query, will likely update the code soon to make it more responsive.

## Installation
No installation required, you can visit the website deployed on GitHub

## Usage
You can view the project I made or I am currently working on. Futur projects will also be presented on this webpage. Helpful to find some partnership in project.
