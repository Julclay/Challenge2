      <p>I have been a nurse for over a decade and decided to change career.
        I always beeing intrigue about programming, I find it very interesting
        and challenging. So when I had the opportunity to join the Bootcamp I just took it
        and I am sure I will learn a lot from it. <br><br>
        In the past I learnt a bit of basic programming here and there by myself looking stuff online,
        it was not very easy, I hope to improve in the futur with bootcamp and other classes. I would also very much
        appreciate any partnership project <br><br>
        So far, I haven't done much project below in the work section you will find some of 
      my futur  project. Hopefully in a few months, years, many projects will be added. </p>

        <p class="parag"> I made an Iphone app using Swift which helped nurses
          to do drug calculations from basics to complex. <br><br> Unfortunately, the 
          app is not available anymore due to incompatibility with new software update. <br><br> It will come back soon with a new website for drug calculation
          and training for nurses
